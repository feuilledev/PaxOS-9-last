## What is PaxOS 9?

PaxOS 9 is an operating system tailored for the PaxoPhone, an ESP32-based device. It aims to provide a functional and responsive user experience on resource-constrained hardware. The OS leverages the Arduino framework for its ESP32 target and includes libraries for graphics (LovyanGFX), touch input (FT6236G), and more. For development and testing, PaxOS 9 can also be compiled and run as a native application on Windows, Linux, and macOS, utilizing SDL2 for graphical simulation.

## Key Features

*   **Lightweight:** Designed to run efficiently on ESP32 microcontrollers.
*   **Open Source:** Distributed under the AGPL-3.0 license, encouraging community contributions.
*   **PlatformIO Based:** Simplifies the build process and dependency management across different platforms.
*   **Hardware Abstraction:** Supports specific hardware components like displays and touchscreens.
*   **Native Simulation:** Allows developers to build, run, and test on desktop environments (Windows, Linux, macOS) using SDL2 for UI simulation.

## Target Hardware

The primary hardware target for PaxOS 9 is the **PaxoPhone V5**, which is based on the **ESP-WROVER-KIT** board (an ESP32 module with PSRAM).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get PaxOS 9 up and running on your machine or target device.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Git:** To clone the repository.
2.  **PlatformIO Core CLI:** PaxOS 9 uses PlatformIO for building and managing the project. Follow the official installation guide: [https://docs.platformio.org/page/core/installation.html](https://docs.platformio.org/page/core/installation.html)
3.  **For Native Desktop Builds (Windows, Linux, macOS):**
    *   A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC depending on your OS).
    *   **SDL2 Development Libraries:** Required for graphical simulation.
        *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`
        *   **macOS (using Homebrew):** `brew install sdl2`
        *   **Windows:** The project includes scripts to help manage SDL2 dependencies (see Windows build section). You might need to ensure MinGW (if using GCC) or MSVC build tools are correctly set up.
    *   **Python:** Required for some pre-build scripts, especially for the Windows environment.
4.  **For Linux Native Builds:**
    *   **NCurses Development Libraries:** `sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev` (or equivalent for your distribution).
    *   **Other Libraries:** You may have to install other libraries depending on your system.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paxo-phone/PaxOS-9.git
cd PaxOS-9
```

## Building and Running PaxOS 9

PaxOS 9 uses PlatformIO environments to manage different build configurations. Here are the common commands:

*   To build a specific environment: `pio run -e <environment_name>`
*   To build and upload (for hardware targets): `pio run -e <environment_name> -t upload`
*   To clean build files for an environment: `pio run -e <environment_name> -t clean`

### 1. For PaxoPhone Hardware (ESP32 - `paxo-v5`)

This environment targets the ESP-WROVER-KIT board, which is the basis for the PaxoPhone V5.

#### Build

```bash
pio run -e paxo-v5
```

#### Upload

Connect your PaxoPhone/ESP-WROVER-KIT to your computer via USB. PlatformIO will attempt to auto-detect the port.

```bash
pio run -e paxo-v5 -t upload
```
If you have issues with port detection, you can specify it using the `upload_port` option in `platformio.ini` or via the command line.

#### Monitor

To view serial output from the device (e.g., for debugging):

```bash
pio device monitor -e paxo-v5 -b 115200
```
The baud rate is set to `115200`.

### 2. For Windows (Native Simulation)

This allows you to run PaxOS 9 as a desktop application on Windows for development and testing, using SDL2 for the display.

#### Build & Run

The `windows` environment includes scripts to set up the workspace, copy dependencies (like SDL2), and execute the compiled program.

```bash
pio run -e windows
```
This command will compile the project and then attempt to run the resulting executable. The necessary SDL2 DLLs should be copied to the build directory by the `copy_dependencies.py` script.

#### Build Only

If you only want to compile the project without running it immediately:

```bash
pio run -e windows-build-only
```
The executable will typically be found in `.pio/build/windows/program.exe`.

### 3. For Linux (Native Simulation)

This allows you to run PaxOS 9 as a desktop application on Linux, using SDL2.

#### Build

Ensure you have installed the SDL2 and NCurses development libraries (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

```bash
pio run -e linux
```

#### Run

After a successful build, you can run the executable:

```bash
.pio/build/linux/program
```

### 4. For macOS (Native Simulation)

This allows you to run PaxOS 9 as a desktop application on macOS, using SDL2.

#### Build

Ensure you have installed SDL2 using Homebrew (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)). The build flags are configured to look for SDL2 in common Homebrew installation paths (`/usr/local/include/SDL2`, `/opt/homebrew/include/SDL2`).

```bash
pio run -e macos
```

#### Run

After a successful build, you can run the executable:

```bash
.pio/build/macos/program
```

### For all builds, if you run them by yourself, you must be running them in the same directory as the ./storage/ one. (Contain the sd-card files).

## Running Tests

PaxOS 9 uses GoogleTest for its unit tests. These tests are typically run on a native platform.

To build and execute the tests:

```bash
pio test -e test
```
This command will compile the code with the `test` environment configuration and run the defined tests. The `test` environment is configured for native execution and may ignore certain libraries not relevant for unit testing (e.g., graphics).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to PaxOS 9, please follow these general steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix`.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
4.  Ensure your code builds successfully for the relevant environments (especially `paxo-v5` and native ones if applicable).
5.  If you add new functionality, consider adding tests.
6.  Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
7.  Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `paxo-phone/PaxOS-9` repository.
